With this app, users can easily translate English text into French. It uses a custom translation model from Hugging Face, and Iâ€™ve incorporated features such as:

Multiline Translation: Translates each line of text separately while maintaining the structure of the original text.

ðŸŒŸ Tech Stack:
Streamlit: For creating the web interface
Hugging Face Transformers: For powerful translation models
Gen AI: Leveraging Generative AI for seamless language translation
LLMs: Cutting-edge Large Language Models for text generation
ðŸ”§ Features:

Translate English text to French line-by-line
Clear and intuitive UI with the ability to reset content
Built with Hugging Face's pre-trained models
This project is a starting point, and I look forward to refining it further and applying what Iâ€™ve learned to larger, more complex applications in the future. Check out the repo and feel free to contribute.
